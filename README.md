# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis-Using-NLP-and-Python

Using NLP and Python, Twitter sentiment analysis analyses tweets to identify the sentiment expressedâ€”whether it be neutral, positive, or negative. The tweets are cleaned and tokenized by text preprocessing, which makes use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. For the purpose of identifying twitter sentiment, machine learning models such as LSTM or Naive Bayes are trained on labelled data.
